Unlike EKS, it doesn't require managing a Kubernetes control plane. You choose how your containers run, either on Amazon EC2 instances or using the serverless option with AWS Fargate.  This flexibility makes ECS a good option for those who want a more hands-on approach to container orchestration on AWS."},{"category":"Amazon Web Services (AWS)","homepage_url":"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/","id":"amazon-web-services-aws--containers--amazon-eks","logo_url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/logos/b5b6b76132c79e5f71721f7d20ec1989f43c7b8c75f789dcb3e09adce18bc05b.svg","name":"Amazon EKS","subcategory":"Containers","description":"Amazon EKS it's a managed Kubernetes service, meaning you don't need to set up and maintain Kubernetes control planes yourself.
