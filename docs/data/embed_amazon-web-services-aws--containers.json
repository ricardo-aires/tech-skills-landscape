EKS lets you focus on deploying and scaling your containerized applications while Amazon takes care of the underlying infrastructure,  making it easier to leverage the benefits of containerization without the management burden."},{"category":"Amazon Web Services (AWS)","id":"amazon-web-services-aws--containers--amazon-ecs","name":"Amazon ECS","logo":"logos/d6f50602be99fa5f9dabeb16ae6c6e389ed550d35e6271b304967a94b853be75.svg","subcategory":"Containers","website":"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/","description":"Amazon ECS offers a simpler way to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications on AWS. Unlike EKS, it doesn't require managing a Kubernetes control plane. You choose how your containers run, either on Amazon EC2 instances or using the serverless option with AWS Fargate.  This flexibility makes ECS a good option for those who want a more hands-on approach to container orchestration on AWS."},{"category":"Amazon Web Services (AWS)","id":"amazon-web-services-aws--containers--amazon-ecr","name":"Amazon ECR","logo":"logos/5afaae231693ea19318d66ecec5ac8d61038be6cb58ddffc45467e70b8589b9f.svg","subcategory":"Containers","website":"https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/","description":"Amazon ECR acts as your secure storage locker for container images on AWS.
